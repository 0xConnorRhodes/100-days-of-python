# 100-days-of-python
Repo for Projects from Dr. Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

This repo will serve as a public record of all the projects I do as part of this course.

Each day of this course has at least one practical python project. Projects are graded automatically on [codingrooms.com](https://www.codingrooms.com/).
