# 100-days-of-python
Repo for Projects from Dr. Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

This repo will serve as a public record of all the projects I do as part of this course.

Each day of this course has at least one practical python project. Projects are graded automatically on [codingrooms.com](https://www.codingrooms.com/). When initial project code is given to rewrite or debug, it is given on [appbrewery's replit.com](https://replit.com/@appbrewery/). You can see my initial activity with this code on [my replit profile](https://replit.com/@0xConnorRhodes).

I started this course on January 31st 2022 and began uploading my code to this repo on February 1st 2022.
